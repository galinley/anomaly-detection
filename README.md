NOTE: It appears that GitHub's Jupyter Notebook viewer is a hit or miss lately when trying to load notebooks. If you get an error message while loading the notebook, just copy the notebook's hyperlink and go to: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/

Then paste the link in at their site to view the notebook. Thanks!
